    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>220 dried apricots</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup apricot preserves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown around the edges, but still pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook for about 3 minutes more. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, bring it to a simmer, and allow it to reduce for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut half of the apricots in half, leaving the others whole. Place the apricots into the skillet, and pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the apricot preserves and thyme. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the apricots have softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>
